# Curso C# Completo

Welcome to the repository dedicated to exercises and projects completed during the "Complete C# Object-Oriented Programming + Projects" course. This course is an immersive exploration into Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) using C#. Beginning from the fundamentals, we start with clear and didactic examples, gradually advancing towards intricate topics such as interfaces, polymorphism, SOLID principles, design patterns, generics, lambda expressions, delegates, LINQ, and much more.

This repository houses the code implementations and solutions crafted during this course, serving as a testament to the practical understanding gained through its comprehensive curriculum.
